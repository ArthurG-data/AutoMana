# MTGStocks Ingestion Pipeline

## Overview

The MTGStocks pipeline ingests Magic: The Gathering price data scraped from MTGStocks and lands it in the `pricing` schema. Unlike the MTGJson and Scryfall feeds, MTGStocks uses a proprietary `print_id` identifier that must first be resolved to the local `card_version_id` before prices can be joined to the rest of the catalogue.

The pipeline is structured in **four stages**, each backed by a dedicated table or stored routine:

| Stage | Input | Routine | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Raw landing | Scraper output | Bulk insert | `pricing.raw_mtg_stock_price` |
| 2. Resolve + stage | `raw_mtg_stock_price` | `pricing.load_staging_prices_batched` | `pricing.stg_price_observation` + `pricing.stg_price_observation_reject` |
| 3. Retry rejects | `stg_price_observation_reject` | `pricing.resolve_price_rejects` | Re-feeds resolved rows back to `stg_price_observation` in same run |
| 4. Load fact | `stg_price_observation` | `pricing.load_prices_from_staged_batched` | `pricing.price_observation` |

All DDL and routines live in [`src/automana/database/SQL/schemas/06_prices.sql`](../src/automana/database/SQL/schemas/06_prices.sql).

## Pricing data model

### The chain: Platonic card → printing → product → listing → observation

```
card_catalog.unique_cards_ref         Platonic card ("Lightning Bolt", the concept)
        │  unique_card_id  (UUID)
        ▼
card_catalog.card_version             A specific printing (set + collector_number + frame)
        │  card_version_id  (UUID)
        ▼
pricing.mtg_card_products             MTG-specific bridge: this printing IS this product (1-to-1)
        │  product_id  (UUID)
        ▼
pricing.product_ref                   Game-agnostic abstract product (MTG, Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, …)
        │  product_id  (UUID)
        ▼
pricing.source_product                Product × Marketplace (e.g., this Bolt on TCGplayer)
        │  source_product_id  (BIGSERIAL)
        ▼
pricing.price_observation             Time-series fact table (TimescaleDB hypertable)
```

### Why the split exists

| Table | Role | Why separate |
|---|---|---|
| `unique_cards_ref` | The Platonic card | Query "all prints of Lightning Bolt" without duplicating rules text. |
| `card_version` | One specific printing | Each print has its own art, set, collector number — and its own price curve. |
| `mtg_card_products` | Bridge `card_version` ⇄ `product_ref` | Keeps MTG-specific join logic out of the game-agnostic `product_ref`. 1-to-1 (`UNIQUE(card_version_id)`). |
| `product_ref` | Game-agnostic product | Pricing schema stays TCG-neutral — sources, conditions, finishes are shared machinery. |
| `source_product` | Product × Source | Same product on multiple marketplaces = different price histories. Observations FK on `source_product_id`, not `product_id`. |
| `price_observation` | Raw time series | Per `(source_product_id, data_provider_id)`, per day, TimescaleDB hypertable (Tier 1). Rolled into `print_price_daily` (Tier 2) by `refresh_daily_prices()`. |

### Dimension reference tables

| Dimension | Ref table | Default helper |
|---|---|---|
| Finish | `pricing.card_finished` | `pricing.default_finish_id()` → `NONFOIL` |
| Condition | `pricing.card_condition` | `pricing.default_condition_id()` → `NM` |
| Language | `card_catalog.language_ref` | `card_catalog.default_language_id()` → `en` |
| Transaction type | `pricing.transaction_type` | — (pipeline hardcodes `sell`) |
| Source | `pricing.price_source` | — (`tcg`, `cardkingdom`, `ebay`, …) |
| Currency | `pricing.currency_ref` | `USD` |
| Data provider | `pricing.data_provider` | — (`mtgstocks`, `mtgjson`, …) |
| Game | `card_catalog.card_games_ref` | — (`mtg`, `pokemon`, …) |

### `price_observation` — the fact table (wide model)

One row = one *(date, product-on-source, transaction type, foil, condition, language, data provider)* tuple, carrying three metric columns plus volume counts:

- `list_low_cents`, `list_avg_cents`, `sold_avg_cents` — prices in cents
- `list_count`, `sold_count` — volumes (not populated by MTGStocks; available for other sources)

**Primary key:** `(ts_date, source_product_id, price_type_id, finish_id, condition_id, language_id, data_provider_id)`

**TimescaleDB characteristics:**
- Hypertable partitioned by `ts_date`
- Chunk interval: **7 days**
- Compression: `segmentby = (source_product_id, price_type_id, finish_id)`, `orderby = ts_date DESC`
- Auto-compression: anything older than **180 days**

### Rollup tiers

| Tier | Table | Grain | Population | Retention |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `pricing.price_observation` | Per `(source_product_id, data_provider_id)`, per day | Inline during Stage 2 | Live + compressed after 180 days |
| 2 | `pricing.print_price_daily` | Per `(card_version_id, source_id)`, per day | `refresh_daily_prices()` via Celery beat (daily) | ~5 years; 7-day chunks, compressed after 30 days |
| 3 | `pricing.print_price_weekly` | Per `(card_version_id, source_id)`, per week (Monday-anchored) | `archive_to_weekly()` via Celery beat (monthly) | Indefinite; 28-day chunks, compressed after 7 days |
| — | `pricing.print_price_latest` | One row per `(card_version_id, source_id, …)` dimension key | Upserted by `refresh_daily_prices()` | Always the most recent price across all tiers |
| — | `pricing.tier_watermark` | One row per tier name (`daily`, `weekly`) | Updated per batch by each procedure | Enables crash-safe resume |

**Source identity is preserved at every tier.** Tier 2 and 3 aggregate across `data_provider_id` only (multiple providers may report the same source on the same day) — `source_id` stays in the primary key so per-market signals remain intact. Aggregation semantics: `MIN(list_low_cents)`, `AVG(list_avg_cents)::int`, `AVG(sold_avg_cents)::int`, `COUNT(DISTINCT data_provider_id)` as `n_providers`.

---

## Stage 1 — Raw landing

**Table:** `pricing.raw_mtg_stock_price`

The scraper bulk-inserts one row per *(print_id, ts_date)* carrying all the raw price columns reported by MTGStocks in source currency units (not cents):

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ts_date` | Observation date |
| `game_code` | Always `mtg` for this feed |
| `print_id` | MTGStocks proprietary id — the resolution key |
| `price_low`, `price_avg`, `price_market` | Nonfoil price metrics (NUMERIC) |
| `price_foil`, `price_market_foil` | Foil price metrics (NUMERIC) |
| `source_code` | e.g. `tcg`, `cardmarket` |
| `scraped_at` | Ingestion timestamp |
| `card_name`, `set_abbr`, `collector_number` | Metadata for fallback lookup |
| `scryfall_id`, `tcg_id`, `cardtrader_id` | External identifiers for fallback lookup |

Index: `idx_raw_price_date (print_id, ts_date)`, `raw_mtg_stock_price_ts_date_idx (ts_date)`.

This table is a landing zone. It is neither cleaned nor deduplicated — the next stage does that.

---

## Stage 2 — Resolve, stage, and promote (inline)

**Routine:** `pricing.load_staging_prices_batched(source_name VARCHAR, batch_days INT DEFAULT 30, p_ingestion_run_id INT DEFAULT NULL)`

Reads `raw_mtg_stock_price`, resolves each row's `print_id` to a `card_version_id`, ensures the product/source-product rows exist, writes resolved rows to `stg_price_observation`, and **immediately promotes them into `pricing.price_observation` within the same batch transaction**. Unresolvable rows go to `stg_price_observation_reject`. After promotion, the staging rows are deleted, so `stg_price_observation` is empty at the end of the run.

**Batched by date** (default 30-day windows) with per-batch `BEGIN/EXCEPTION/COMMIT` so a bad window doesn't poison the run.

> **Note on Stage 4:** Because Stage 2 now performs inline promotion, `stg_price_observation` is drained after every batch. The separate `from_staging_to_prices` pipeline step (`load_prices_from_staged_batched`) is therefore a no-op on a normal run and exists only as a safety net for edge cases where staging retains leftover rows (e.g. a crashed mid-batch restart). **Wall-clock time for a full historical backfill is ~4 hours** (single-core), not the ~30 hours previously documented for a two-pass approach.

### Resolution waterfall

For each raw row, `card_version_id` is resolved in strict priority order:

1. **`print_id` map** — join through `card_catalog.card_external_identifier` where `identifier_name = 'mtgstock_id'`. This is the happy path once back-fills have run.
2. **External IDs** (fallback): try in order `scryfall_id` → `tcgplayer_id` → `cardtrader_id`. Respects `card_catalog.scryfall_migration` for `merge`/`move` strategies.
3. **Set + collector number** (last resort): `set_abbr` + `collector_number`, with optional `card_name` cross-check when available.

The resolution method (`PRINT_ID` / `EXTERNAL_ID` / `SET_COLLECTOR` / `UNRESOLVED`) is recorded for observability.

### Back-fill of the print_id map

When a raw row is resolved via path (2) or (3), the procedure back-fills `card_external_identifier` so the next run resolves via path (1). Only unambiguous `print_id → card_version_id` pairs (no conflict within the batch) are back-filled.

### Ensure product + source_product

For every newly resolved `card_version_id` without a `pricing.mtg_card_products` row, the procedure generates a `product_id` UUID, inserts it into `product_ref` and `mtg_card_products`, then ensures a `(product_id, source_id)` row exists in `source_product`.

### Write to staging

Resolved rows are inserted into `pricing.stg_price_observation` (wide model — see below). Unresolved rows are inserted into `pricing.stg_price_observation_reject` with `reject_reason` = `'Could not resolve card_version_id via print_id/external_id/set+collector'`.

### `stg_price_observation` shape (wide)

| Column | Notes |
|---|---|
| `stg_id BIGSERIAL PK` | Surrogate for the DELETE key in stage 4 |
| `ts_date`, `game_code`, `print_id` | From raw |
| `list_low_cents`, `list_avg_cents`, `sold_avg_cents` | Nullable — each staging row may carry only a subset |
| `is_foil` | Derived from which raw price column the row came from |
| `source_code`, `data_provider_id` | Source and provider (both NOT NULL) |
| `value` | Raw source-currency value (for audit) |
| `product_id UUID`, `card_version_id UUID`, `source_product_id BIGINT` | Resolved references |
| `set_abbr`, `collector_number`, `card_name`, `scryfall_id`, `tcg_id` | Audit metadata |
| `scraped_at` | From raw |

Indexes: `stg_price_obs_date_spid_foil_idx (ts_date, source_product_id, is_foil)`.

---

## Stage 3 — Retry rejects

**Routine:** `pricing.resolve_price_rejects(p_limit INT DEFAULT 50000, p_only_unresolved BOOL DEFAULT TRUE)`

Picks up to `p_limit` unresolved rejects and retries resolution. Takes fresh `scryfall_migration` data into account, so rejects from before a migration landed can be retroactively resolved. Runs **before** Stage 4 so that newly-resolved rows are promoted to `price_observation` in the same pipeline run.

### Pipeline

1. Slice candidates into `tmp_rejects` (`resolved_at IS NULL AND is_terminal IS FALSE`, or everything if `p_only_unresolved := FALSE`).
2. Re-run the same resolution waterfall as stage 2 (`print_id` → external IDs → set+collector), producing `tmp_resolved`.
3. Back-fill `card_external_identifier` for rows resolved via EXTERNAL_ID or SET_COLLECTOR so future runs hit the cheaper PRINT_ID path.
4. Ensure `product_ref` + `mtg_card_products` for any newly-resolved `card_version_id`.
5. Ensure `source_product` for each `(product_id, mtgstocks source_id)` pair.
6. **Re-feed** resolved rejects into `stg_price_observation` — with the full wide payload. Skips rows where all three cents columns are NULL.
7. **Mark** the reject row terminal:
   - Successful retries → `terminal_reason = 'Resolved via <METHOD> mapping'`.
   - Rows whose `scryfall_id` is in `scryfall_migration` with `migration_strategy = 'delete'` → `terminal_reason = 'Scryfall migration delete and no alternative identifiers'`.

### Match key for the terminal update

The reject table has no surrogate key. The match predicate is `(ts_date, print_id, is_foil, source_code, data_provider_id, scraped_at)`. If this is ever not unique in practice, add `rej_id BIGSERIAL PRIMARY KEY` to `stg_price_observation_reject` and carry it through `tmp_rejects → tmp_resolved`.

### Returns

`bigint` — number of rows re-fed into `stg_price_observation`. Those rows are then promoted to `price_observation` by Stage 4 in the same run.

---

## Stage 4 — Load fact table (safety net only)

**Routine:** `pricing.load_prices_from_staged_batched(batch_days INT DEFAULT 30)`

Moves any remaining staging rows into `pricing.price_observation`. On a normal run this is a no-op because Stage 2 already drained `stg_price_observation` via inline promotion. It is retained as a safety net for edge cases (e.g. a row landed in staging outside the normal pipeline).

### Pre-flight (once per call)

1. `SET LOCAL work_mem = 512MB`, `maintenance_work_mem = 1GB`, `synchronous_commit = off`.
2. Resolve dimension ids once: `finish_default_id`, `finish_foil_id` (fallback to default if no FOIL row), `price_type_id` (`sell`, hard RAISE if empty), `condition_id` (`NM`), `language_id` (`en`).
3. Compute `min(ts_date)` and `max(ts_date)` across staging. Early RETURN if empty.

### Per-batch body (inside `BEGIN/EXCEPTION`)

**A. Build `_batch` (TEMP, `ON COMMIT DROP`)**
- Select from `stg_price_observation` where `ts_date` falls in the window.
- Map `is_foil → finish_id` via CASE on the pre-resolved smallints.
- Carry `stg_id` for the later DELETE.
- Skip rows where all three cents columns are NULL (nothing to observe).

**B. Build `_dedup`**
- `row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY <full fact PK> ORDER BY scraped_at DESC, stg_id DESC)`, keep `rn=1`.
- Secondary order by `stg_id DESC` makes ties deterministic.

**C. Upsert into `pricing.price_observation`**
- `ON CONFLICT (ts_date, source_product_id, price_type_id, finish_id, condition_id, language_id, data_provider_id)`
- `DO UPDATE`: per-column **"newest non-null wins"** on the three cents columns — a newer scrape with a NULL does not wipe a valid older value.
- `scraped_at = GREATEST(existing, EXCLUDED.scraped_at)`, `updated_at = now()`.

**D. Drain staging**
- `DELETE FROM stg_price_observation WHERE stg_id IN (SELECT stg_id FROM _batch)` — exact 1-to-1 match to what entered the batch.

**E. Commit or rollback**
- On success: `COMMIT` the batch.
- On exception: `RAISE WARNING` with `SQLERRM` + `SQLSTATE`, `ROLLBACK`, loop continues to the next batch.

### Known ceiling: compressed chunks

If staging ever carries rows older than 180 days, the upsert fails with `cannot update compressed chunk`. Mitigation is architectural: keep staging drained inside the compression window, or add an explicit decompression step for out-of-window batches.

## Operational notes

### Observed performance (full historical backfill, 228 M raw rows, 2012–2026)

| Step | Wall time | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `bulk_load` | ~38 min | COPY parquet → `raw_mtg_stock_price` |
| `from_raw_to_staging` | ~4 hours | Inline resolve + stage + promote + drain per 30-day batch |
| `retry_rejects` | ~6 s | Resolves up to 50 000 reject rows; 0 resolved on initial backfill (see § Retry rejects) |
| `from_staging_to_prices` | no-op | Staging already drained by Stage 2 |

---

### `bulk_load` service — non-atomic execution and extended timeout

`mtg_stock.data_staging.bulk_load` is registered with `runs_in_transaction=False` and `command_timeout=3600`.

**Why non-atomic:** the asyncpg pool's default `command_timeout` is 60 s (see `core/db/database.py`). A single COPY of a 10 000-folder batch can exceed that limit, which surfaces as `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'done'` inside asyncpg's `base_protocol.py`. Running without an outer transaction also allows per-batch audit rows to commit incrementally rather than being held open for the entire bulk load.

**Re-run idempotency:** `pricing.raw_mtg_stock_price` has no primary key or uniqueness constraint. `bulk_load` issues a `DELETE FROM pricing.raw_mtg_stock_price` before starting the folder traversal so each run starts from a clean landing table. If `bulk_load` crashes after the clear but before all folders are loaded, re-running will start clean again — no duplicate accumulation. Stage 4 (`load_prices_from_staged_batched`) deduplicates on the fact-table primary key regardless, so any duplicates that slipped through would not propagate to `pricing.price_observation`.

### Idempotency

- Stage 2 is idempotent on a per-row basis: re-inserting the same `(ts_date, print_id, scraped_at)` produces a duplicate staging row, but stage 4's dedup collapses them before the upsert. Still, avoid re-running stage 2 over the same raw window without draining staging first — it wastes work.
- Stage 3 is safe to run repeatedly — it only picks rejects that are not yet terminal.
- Stage 4 is strictly idempotent: the ON CONFLICT clause ensures re-running over the same window is a no-op if nothing has changed.

### Chaining under Celery

The active Celery chain in `worker/tasks/pipelines.py::mtgStock_download_pipeline`:

1. `ops.pipeline_services.start_run`
2. `mtg_stock.data_staging.bulk_load` → COPY parquet files into `raw_mtg_stock_price`
3. `mtg_stock.data_staging.from_raw_to_staging` → calls `load_staging_prices_batched`
4. `mtg_stock.data_staging.retry_rejects` → calls `resolve_price_rejects`
5. `mtg_stock.data_staging.from_staging_to_prices` → calls `load_prices_from_staged_batched`
6. `ops.pipeline_services.finish_run`

Context keys between steps must match parameter names (the `run_service` dispatcher filters by signature — see [`CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md)).

### Observability

Each routine emits `RAISE NOTICE` per batch and a final summary. Exceptions emit `RAISE WARNING` with `SQLERRM` + `SQLSTATE`. When invoked from a Celery step, those surface in the worker logs via PostgreSQL's client messages.

## Sanity report / integrity checks

`ops.integrity.mtgstock_report` is a runner service that queries eleven registered `mtgstock.*` metrics and returns the standard integrity-report envelope used by all `ops.integrity.*` services (same shape as `ops.integrity.scryfall_run_diff`).

### CLI usage

```bash
# run all mtgstock metrics against the most recent run
automana-run ops.integrity.mtgstock_report

# filter to specific metrics (comma-separated string)
automana-run ops.integrity.mtgstock_report --metrics "mtgstock.link_rate_pct,mtgstock.pipeline_duration_seconds"

# filter by category
automana-run ops.integrity.mtgstock_report --category health

# target a specific ingestion run id
automana-run ops.integrity.mtgstock_report --ingestion_run_id 42
```

The `metrics` parameter accepts a comma-separated string because the CLI coerces all flag values as scalars. The runner splits it internally.

### Return envelope

```json
{
  "check_set": "mtgstock_report",
  "total_checks": 11,
  "error_count": 0,
  "warn_count": 1,
  "ok_count": 10,
  "errors": [],
  "warnings": [...],
  "passed": [...],
  "rows": [...]
}
```

Each row has keys: `check_name`, `severity` (`"ok"` / `"warn"` / `"error"`), `row_count`, `details`.

### Metrics reference

| Metric path | Category | What it reports | Severity rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mtgstock.pipeline_duration_seconds` | timing | Wall-clock duration of the run in seconds | Warn ≥ 1800 s, Error ≥ 3600 s |
| `mtgstock.run_status` | status | Final status string of the run | `success`→ok, `partial`/`running`/`pending`→warn, all else→error |
| `mtgstock.steps_failed_count` | health | Count of `ingestion_run_steps` with `status='failed'` | Warn/Error ≥ 1 |
| `mtgstock.step_durations` | timing | Per-step duration dict (informational) | None — always ok |
| `mtgstock.raw_prints_loaded` | volume | `COUNT(DISTINCT print_id)` in `pricing.raw_mtg_stock_price` | Warn ≤ 50 000, Error ≤ 1 000 |
| `mtgstock.raw_rows_loaded` | volume | `COUNT(*)` in `pricing.raw_mtg_stock_price` | Warn ≤ 500 000, Error ≤ 10 000 |
| `mtgstock.cards_linked_to_card_version` | volume | `stg_price_observation` rows with non-NULL `card_version_id` | Warn ≤ 50 000, Error ≤ 1 000 |
| `mtgstock.cards_rejected` | health | Row count in `stg_price_observation_reject` | Warn ≥ 5 000, Error ≥ 50 000 |
| `mtgstock.link_rate_pct` | health | `100 × linked / (linked + rejected)` | Warn ≤ 95 %, Error ≤ 80 % |
| `mtgstock.bulk_load_folder_errors` | health | `SUM(items_failed)` across `bulk_load` step batches | Warn ≥ 100, Error ≥ 1 000 |
| `mtgstock.rows_promoted_to_price_observation` | volume | Rows in `pricing.price_observation` with `scraped_at` inside the run's window and `source_code='mtgstocks'` | Warn ≤ 100 000, Error ≤ 1 000 |

### "Current state" vs per-run semantics

Metrics in the `volume` and `health` categories that read staging tables (`raw_mtg_stock_price`, `stg_price_observation`, `stg_price_observation_reject`) report the **current state** of those tables, not a snapshot from a specific run. The staging tables are repopulated each run and carry no `ingestion_run_id` column, so the current state after the most recent run is the only meaningful scope for those metrics. Passing `--ingestion_run_id` to these metrics has no effect on the staging table queries; the parameter is accepted for API uniformity.

Run-level metrics (`pipeline_duration_seconds`, `run_status`, `steps_failed_count`, `step_durations`, `bulk_load_folder_errors`, `rows_promoted_to_price_observation`) do target a specific run id. When `--ingestion_run_id` is omitted each of them resolves to the most recent `mtg_stock_all` run via `OpsRepository.get_latest_run_id`.

### Auto-discovery

The service is listed in every `SERVICE_MODULES` namespace (`backend`, `celery`, `all`) in `core/framework/service_modules.py`. It is auto-discovered by the `pipeline-health-check` skill because its path matches the `ops.integrity.*` prefix.
